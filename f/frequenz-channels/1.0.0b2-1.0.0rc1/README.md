 """Select the first among multiple Receivers.
 
-Expects Receiver class to raise `StopAsyncIteration`
-exception once no more messages are expected or the channel
-is closed in case of `Receiver` class.
+# Usage
+
+If you need to receiver different types of messages from different receivers, you need
+to know the source of a particular received message to know the type of the message.
+
+[`select()`][frequenz.channels.select] allows you to do that. It is an
+[async iterator][typing.AsyncIterator] that will iterate over the messages of all
+receivers as they receive new messages.
+
+It yields a [`Selected`][frequenz.channels.Selected] object that will tell you the
+source of the received message. To make sure the received message is *cast* to the
+correct type, you need to use the [`selected_from()`][frequenz.channels.selected_from]
+function to check the source of the message, and the
+[`message`][frequenz.channels.Selected.message] attribute to access the message:
+
+```python show_lines="8:"
+from frequenz.channels import Anycast, ReceiverStoppedError, select, selected_from
+
+channel1: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel1")
+channel2: Anycast[str] = Anycast(name="channel2")
+receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
+receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()
+
+async for selected in select(receiver1, receiver2):
+    if selected_from(selected, receiver1):
+        print(f"Received from receiver1, next number: {selected.message + 1}")
+    elif selected_from(selected, receiver2):
+        print(f"Received from receiver2, length: {len(selected.message)}")
+    else:
+        assert False, "Unknown source, this should never happen"
+```
+
+Tip:
+    To prevent common bugs, like when a new receiver is added to the select loop but
+    the handling code is forgotten, [`select()`][frequenz.channels.select] will check
+    that all the selected receivers are handled in the if-chain.
+
+    If this happens, it will raise an
+    [`UnhandledSelectedError`][frequenz.channels.UnhandledSelectedError] exception.
+
+    If for some reason you want to ignore a received message, just add the receiver to
+    the if-chain and do nothing with the message:
+
+    ```python show_lines="8:"
+    from frequenz.channels import Anycast, select, selected_from
+
+    channel1: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel1")
+    channel2: Anycast[str] = Anycast(name="channel2")
+    receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
+    receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()
+
+    async for selected in select(receiver1, receiver2):
+        if selected_from(selected, receiver1):
+            continue
+        if selected_from(selected, receiver2):
+            print(f"Received from receiver2, length: {len(selected.message)}")
+    ```
+
+# Stopping
+
+The `select()` async iterator will stop as soon as all the receivers are stopped. You
+can also end the iteration early by breaking out of the loop as normal.
+
+When a single [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] is stopped, it will be reported
+via the [`Selected`][frequenz.channels.Selected] object. You can use the
+[`was_stopped`][frequenz.channels.Selected.was_stopped] method to check if the
+selected [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] was stopped:
+
+```python show_lines="8:"
+from frequenz.channels import Anycast, select, selected_from
+
+channel1: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel1")
+channel2: Anycast[str] = Anycast(name="channel2")
+receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
+receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()
+
+async for selected in select(receiver1, receiver2):
+    if selected_from(selected, receiver1):
+        if selected.was_stopped:
+            print("receiver1 was stopped")
+            continue
+        print(f"Received from receiver1, the next number is: {selected.message + 1}")
+    # ...
+```
+
+Tip:
+    The [`was_stopped`][frequenz.channels.Selected.was_stopped] method is a
+    convenience method that is equivalent to checking if the
+    [`exception`][frequenz.channels.Selected.exception] attribute is an instance of
+    [`ReceiverStoppedError`][frequenz.channels.ReceiverStoppedError].
+
+# Error Handling
+
+Tip:
+    For more information about handling errors, please refer to the
+    [Error Handling](/user-guide/error-handling/) section of the user guide.
+
+If a receiver raises an exception while receiving a message, the exception will be
+raised by the [`message`][frequenz.channels.Selected.message] attribute of the
+[`Selected`][frequenz.channels.Selected] object.
+
+You can use a try-except block to handle exceptions as usual:
+
+```python show_lines="8:"
+from frequenz.channels import Anycast, ReceiverStoppedError, select, selected_from
+
+channel1: Anycast[int] = Anycast(name="channel1")
+channel2: Anycast[str] = Anycast(name="channel2")
+receiver1 = channel1.new_receiver()
+receiver2 = channel2.new_receiver()
+
+async for selected in select(receiver1, receiver2):
+    if selected_from(selected, receiver1):
+        try:
+            print(f"Received from receiver1, next number: {selected.message + 1}")
+        except ReceiverStoppedError:
+            print("receiver1 was stopped")
+        except ValueError as value_error:
+            print(f"receiver1 raised a ValueError: {value_error}")
+        # ...
+    # ...
+```
+
+The [`Selected`][frequenz.channels.Selected] object also has a
+[`exception`][frequenz.channels.Selected.exception] attribute that will contain the
+exception that was raised by the receiver.

     An exhaustiveness check is performed at runtime to make sure all selected receivers
     are handled in the if-chain, so you should call `selected_from()` with all the
     receivers passed to `select()` inside the select loop, even if you plan to ignore
-    a value, to signal `select()` that you are purposefully ignoring the value.
+    a message, to signal `select()` that you are purposefully ignoring the message.
 
     Note:
         The `select()` function is intended to be used in cases where the set of
         receivers is static and known beforehand.  If you need to dynamically add/remove
         receivers from a select loop, there are a few alternatives.  Depending on your
         use case, one or the other could work better for you:
 
-        * Use [`Merge`][frequenz.channels.util.Merge] or
-          [`MergeNamed`][frequenz.channels.util.MergeNamed]: this is useful when you
-          have and unknown number of receivers of the same type that can be handled as
-          a group.
+        * Use [`merge()`][frequenz.channels.merge]: this is useful when you have an
+          unknown number of receivers of the same type that can be handled as a group.
         * Use tasks to manage each receiver individually: this is better if there are no
           relationships between the receivers.
         * Break the `select()` loop and start a new one with the new set of receivers
           (this should be the last resort, as it has some performance implications
            because the loop needs to be restarted).
 
     Example:
         ```python
         import datetime

-"""A timer receiver that ticks every `interval`.
+"""A receiver that sends a message regularly.
 
-Note:
-    This module always use `int`s to represent time.  The time is always in
-    microseconds, so the timer resolution is 1 microsecond.
+# Quick Start
 
-    This is to avoid floating point errors when performing calculations with
-    time, which can lead to very hard to reproduce, and debug, issues.
+Info: Important
+    This quick start is provided to have a quick feeling of how to use this module, but
+    it is extremely important to understand how timers behave when they are delayed.
+
+    We recommend emphatically to read about [missed ticks and
+    drifting](#missed-ticks-and-drifting) before using timers in production.
+
+If you need to do something as periodically as possible (avoiding
+[drifts](#missed-ticks-and-drifting)), you can use
+a [`Timer`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer] like this:
+
+Example: Periodic Timer Example
+    ```python
+    import asyncio
+    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
+
+    from frequenz.channels.timer import Timer
+
+
+    async def main() -> None:
+        async for drift in Timer(timedelta(seconds=1.0), TriggerAllMissed()):
+            print(f"The timer has triggered at {datetime.now()} with a drift of {drift}")
+
+
+    asyncio.run(main())
+    ```
+
+    This timer will tick as close as every second as possible, even if the loop is busy
+    doing something else for a good amount of time. In extreme cases, if the loop was
+    busy for a few seconds, the timer will trigger a few times in a row to catch up, one
+    for every missed tick.
+
+If, instead, you need a timeout, for example to abort waiting for other receivers after
+a certain amount of time, you can use a [`Timer`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer] like
+this:
+
+Example: Timeout Example
+    ```python
+    import asyncio
+    from datetime import timedelta
+
+    from frequenz.channels import Anycast, select, selected_from
+    from frequenz.channels.timer import Timer
+
+
+    async def main() -> None:
+        channel = Anycast[int](name="data-channel")
+        data_receiver = channel.new_receiver()
+
+        timer = Timer(timedelta(seconds=1.0), SkipMissedAndDrift())
+
+        async for selected in select(data_receiver, timer):
+            if selected_from(selected, data_receiver):
+                print(f"Received data: {selected.message}")
+                timer.reset()
+            elif selected_from(selected, timer):
+                drift = selected.message
+                print(f"No data received for {timer.interval + drift} seconds, giving up")
+                break
+
+
+    asyncio.run(main())
+    ```
+
+    This timer will *rearm* itself automatically after it was triggered, so it will
+    trigger again after the selected interval, no matter what the current drift was. So
+    if the loop was busy for a few seconds, the timer will trigger immediately and then
+    wait for another second before triggering again. The missed ticks are skipped.
+
+# Missed Ticks And Drifting
+
+A [`Timer`][frequenz.channels.timer.Timer] can be used to send a messages at regular
+time intervals, but there is one fundamental issue with timers in the [asyncio][] world:
+the event loop could give control to another task at any time, and that task can take
+a long time to finish, making the time it takes the next timer message to be received
+longer than the desired interval.
+
+Because of this, it is very important for users to be able to understand and control
+how timers behave when they are delayed. Timers will handle missed ticks according to
+a *missing tick policy*.
+
+The following built-in policies are available:
+
+* [`SkipMissedAndDrift`][frequenz.channels.timer.SkipMissedAndDrift]:
+    {{docstring_summary("frequenz.channels.timer.SkipMissedAndDrift")}}

-    These are the currently built-in available policies:

-    * [`SkipMissedAndDrift`][frequenz.channels.util.SkipMissedAndDrift]
-    * [`SkipMissedAndResync`][frequenz.channels.util.SkipMissedAndResync]
-    * [`TriggerAllMissed`][frequenz.channels.util.TriggerAllMissed]
-
-    For the most common cases, a specialized constructor is provided:
-
-    * [`periodic()`][frequenz.channels.util.Timer.periodic] (uses the

-    * [`timeout()`][frequenz.channels.util.Timer.timeout] (uses the
-      [`SkipMissedAndDrift`][frequenz.channels.util.SkipMissedAndDrift] policy)
-
-    The timer accepts an optional [`loop`][frequenz.channels.util.Timer.loop], which
-    will be used to track the time. If `loop` is `None`, then the running loop will be
-    used (if there is no running loop most calls will raise
-    a [`RuntimeError`][RuntimeError]).
-
-    Starting the timer can be delayed if necessary by using `auto_start=False`
-    (for example until we have a running loop). A call to
